# i18n (Internationalization) in Flask

## Description

This project focuses on implementing internationalization (i18n) in a Flask web application. The goal is to learn how to:

- Parametrize Flask templates to support multiple languages.
- Infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- Localize timestamps using appropriate timezone handling.

## Resources

Before starting, read or watch:

- [Flask-Babel](https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel/)
- [Flask i18n tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xiii-i18n-and-l10n)
- [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to use Flask-Babel for internationalization.
- Implement locale detection from different sources (URL parameters, user settings, request headers).
- Format dates and times according to different locales.

## Requirements

- All files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**.
- All files should end with a **new line**.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is **mandatory**.
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.5).
- The first line of all Python files must be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  ```
- All Python files (`*.py`) should be **executable**.
- Modules, classes, and functions must include **docstrings** explaining their purpose.
- **Type annotations** are required for all functions and coroutines.
